# XGR Wallet Connect — How to connect your wallet

This guide shows how to connect a browser wallet (e.g., **MetaMask**) to the XGR app, pick the right **chain** (Mainnet/Testnet), and fix common issues. Clear, customer-friendly, same style as the Read-Key guide.

---

## 1) What you need

- **A browser wallet** (e.g., MetaMask, Trust Wallet extension).  
  → Install & network setup: **https://xgr.network/networks.html**
- **A supported browser**: Chrome, Brave, Edge, or Firefox.  
- Optional: **Hardware wallet** (Ledger/Trezor) via MetaMask.

> If no wallet is installed, the panel will say **“No Ethereum provider detected.”** Use the link above to install a wallet, then reload the page.

## 2) Quick start

1. Install and enable your wallet in the browser.  
2. Open the **Wallet Connect** panel in the XGR app.  
3. Pick the **chain**: *XGR Mainnet* (live) or *XGR Testnet* (try-out).  
4. Pick your **wallet** (e.g., MetaMask).  
5. Click **Connect** and approve the wallet dialogs.  
6. The status shows **Connected** with your address; use **Disconnect** to stop.

**Next steps (builders)**  
Go to **XRC-137 Builder** → https://app.xgr.network/builder/137  
or **XRC-729 Builder** → https://app.xgr.network/builder/729

**What you see (no wallet installed)**

## 3) Choose the chain (network)

- **XGR Mainnet** — Chain-ID `0x66B`, RPC `https://rpc.xgr.network`, Explorer `https://explorer.xgr.network`  
- **XGR Testnet** — Chain-ID `0x68B`, RPC `https://rpc.testnet.xgr.network`, Explorer `https://explorer.testnet.xgr.network`

The app already knows these networks. Modern wallets will ask to **add/switch** when needed — simply confirm.

> Tip: Use **XGR Testnet** when you want to test; use **XGR Mainnet** for real transactions.

---

## 4) Pick your wallet

The panel auto-detects installed wallets (EIP-6963 discovery) and lists them (MetaMask, Trust Wallet, etc.).  
If nothing is found, you’ll see the hint with a link to the **installation page**. After installing, reload the page.

---

## 5) Connect & disconnect

- **Connect** opens wallet dialogs so you can grant access to your address.  
- After connecting, the panel shows **Connected** and your address (`0x1234…`).  
- **Disconnect** ends the session in the app (the browser extension remains installed).

> **Security:** Connecting only grants **read access** to your address/network. **Transactions or signatures never happen without an explicit wallet prompt.**

---

## 6) Panel elements (explained)

- **Chain select** (left): choose Mainnet/Testnet (may be project-locked).  
- **Wallet select** (middle): choose a detected wallet (e.g., MetaMask).  
- **Connect/Disconnect** (right): connects or disconnects. The button is disabled if **no wallet is detected** or **no wallet is selected**.  
- **Hint line**: shows **“No Ethereum provider detected”** with a link if nothing is installed.  
- **Status line**: shows **Connecting wallet…**, **Connected: 0x…**, or error text.

---

## 7) Troubleshooting

**A) Wallet not detected**  
- Install/enable a wallet → **https://xgr.network/networks.html**  
- Reload the page; pin the extension in the browser (puzzle icon).

**B) Wrong network / chain**  
- Switch to the **XGR chain** in your wallet. When prompted, **add** and **switch**.

**C) Connect failed / no dialog**  
- Check the popup blocker. Unlock the wallet, then click **Connect** again.  
- If cancelled multiple times, reload the page and try again.

**D) Hardware wallet**  
- Connect via MetaMask (import your Ledger/Trezor account). Then click **Connect**.

**E) Switched account or wallet**  
- Change the account in your wallet → in the panel use **Disconnect** then **Connect** to refresh the address.

## Where Wallet Connect sits in the flow

Wallet Connect is **step 1 of 4** (Wallet → Compile → Deploy → Update).
