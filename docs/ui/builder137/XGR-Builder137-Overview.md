# XGR Builder 137 — Overview

This page gives you a high-level tour of the **Builder 137** UI: what each section does, how the **four-step flow** works, and how to use the **right‑side dock** to show/hide panels. It links to the detailed guides for every panel.

## What the page looks like

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/builder-137main.png) — The Builder page with creation panels on the left (Payload, Contract Reads, APIs, Rules, Outputs, Validation, Preview) and the operational panels below (Wallet Connect, Compile, Deploy, Update). The vertical flow on the right shows **Wallet → Compile → Deploy → Update**.

---

## The four-step flow

Builder 137 guides you through these steps in order:

1. **Wallet** — connect a browser wallet (e.g., MetaMask) and select a chain.  
2. **Compile** — build artifacts via XGR’s managed Hardhat service.  
3. **Deploy** — deploy the wrapper contract (plain or encrypted).  
4. **Update** — push rule changes to an existing contract (plain or encrypted).

The flow highlights the **next active** step and places a **check mark** after each successful action. If **Validation** finds errors, **Compile** is disabled until you fix them.

> Detailed guides:  
> • Wallet → `XGR-Wallet-Connect-Guide.md`  
> • Compile → `XGR-Compile-Guide.md`  
> • Deploy → `XGR-Deploy-Guide.md`  
> • Update → `XGR-Update-Guide.md`

## The creation panels (top)

- **Payload** — define input fields available to rules.  
- **Contract Reads** — read on-chain data; store outputs via `saveAs` aliases or indices.  
- **APIs** — call external APIs and extract data into aliases.  
- **Rules** — build boolean logic using payload fields, read keys, and API extraction results.  
- **Outputs** — define `onValid`/`onInvalid` payloads and optional **encrypted logs** with expiry.  
- **Validation** — live checks with actionable messages; blocks **Compile** on errors.  
- **Preview** — view/copy/download the normalized JSON and generated Solidity wrapper.

## The right-side dock (icon menu)

Use the dock to **toggle panel visibility** (desktop) or the small **mobile bar** (phones). Hover to see the label; click to show/hide a section. The **Read Key** tab appears only when opened.

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/builder-137-docker-menu.png) — Dock icons from top to bottom: **Creation**, **Contract Reads**, **APIs**, **Rules**, **Code Preview**, **Wallet**, **Compile**, **Deploy**, **Update** (and **Read Key** when open). Active items are highlighted; done steps also show as completed in the flow.

**Icons**
- **Creation** (boxes): show/hide the creation stack (Payload → Validation).  
- **Contract Reads** (book‑check): toggle contract reads panel.  
- **APIs** (braces): toggle APIs panel.  
- **Rules** (scales): toggle rules panel.  
- **Code Preview** (</>): toggle preview (JSON/Solidity).  
- **Wallet** (plug): toggle wallet panel.  
- **Compile** (play): toggle compile panel.  
- **Deploy** (upload): toggle deploy panel.  
- **Update** (refresh): toggle update panel.  
- **Read Key** (key): appears when the Read‑Key window is open; click to minimize/show.

## Tips

- Keep an eye on **Validation** before compiling.  
- Use **Testnet** for trial runs; switch to **Mainnet** when ready.  
- For encrypted operations, see **Encryption & Grants** → https://xgr.network/docs.html#xrc563
