# XGR Gas Estimate Panel (UI Guide)
This guide shows how to use the **Gas Estimate** panel on the XRC-137 Builder page to preview on-chain execution costs for your rule. It follows the same style as the Rules guide and uses the same “What you see” image blocks.

---

## 1) What the Gas Estimate does

The Gas Estimate panel queries the XGR node to calculate an **estimated gas breakdown** for your current rule model. It provides:
- a **Total (all-in)** worst-case estimate across branches,
- a per-branch breakdown (**onValid** / **onInvalid**),
- details for validation overhead, EVM transaction & calldata, engine logs, and inner calls,
- **JSON export** for audits and reviews.

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/gas-panel-overview.png) — The Gas panel opened below Validation with **Estimate**, **What’s this?**, and **Show details** buttons visible.

---

## 2) Prerequisites

- **Wallet connected** to pick the active RPC (same as Wallet Connect).  
- **Validation clean**: fix all validation errors first — otherwise the Gas button is disabled.  
- If you use encrypted logs, confirm your rule JSON sets `encryptLogs` and `logExpireDays` for each branch.

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/gas-panel-guard.png) — Disabled **Gas estimate** button with short hints when validation fails or wallet is not connected.

---

## 3) Open the panel

You can open the Gas panel in two ways:
1. Click **Gas estimate** in the **Validation** section.  
2. Use the right-side **dock button** “Gas” (appears after the panel was opened once).

The panel opens **directly under Validation**. Use **Hide** to minimize it to the dock, or **Close** to remove it entirely.

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/gas-open-under-validation.png) — Gas panel expanded directly under Validation; the dock shows the active “Gas” tab.

---

## 4) Run an estimate

Press **Estimate**. The builder sends your current rule JSON to the node via `xgr_estimateRuleGas` (no auto-refresh; estimates run only on button click).  
Encrypted logs are inferred from your JSON per branch. The result returns **branch totals** and a **worst‑case total**.

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/gas-panel-run.png) — After pressing **Estimate**, totals and branch cards are populated.

---

## 5) Reading the summary

### Total (all-in)
Shows **`totalWorstCase`** — the maximum of both branches’ totals. Use this as a conservative estimate for budgeting.

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/gas-total-allin.png) — “Total (all-in)” card with worst-case value and a short help tooltip.

## 6) Branch breakdown (onValid / onInvalid)

Each branch card contains the fields below. Hover the **?** markers for quick hints.

| Field                          | Meaning (concise)                                                                                                  |
|-------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Total**                     | All-in gas for the branch.                                                                                          |
| **ValidationGas**             | Engine validation & preparation (**off-chain** heuristic; not EVM gas).                                             |
| **EVM.Tx+Calldata**           | Base transaction cost plus calldata size for `ENGINE_EXECUTE`.                                                      |
| **Logs**                      | Estimated gas for engine events (EngineMeta/Extras).                                                                |
| **Inner.Execution (limit)**   | Upper bound for user execution gas (if your rule supplies a limit).                                                 |
| **Inner.Grant (estimateGas)** | Estimated gas for the helper grant call — *runtime cost when executed on-chain*.                                    |
| **Grant.Gas**                 | Gas for the grant transaction itself — *runtime cost at execution*.                                                 |
| **Grant.Value (XGR)**         | XGR value sent with the grant transaction — *runtime cost at execution*.                                            |
| **EncryptLogs**               | Whether logs are encrypted for this branch.                                                                         |
| **expireDays**                | Retention period in **days** for persisted logs.                                                                    |
| **expireAt**                  | Absolute expiry timestamp shown as a local **US** date/time (source is Unix seconds since 1970).                    |

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/gas-branch-breakdown.png) — A branch card with all fields visible; tooltips opened over **Inner.Grant** and **Grant.Gas/Value** emphasizing *runtime costs*.

## 7) Field help (“What’s this?”)

Click **What’s this?** to show a concise description of each field and how the total is composed (validation + tx/calldata + logs + inner calls). The copy mirrors the in‑UI tooltips and explicitly notes which items are **runtime costs** (incurred when the contract actually executes on-chain).

**What you see**

## 8) Details (JSON)

Click **Show details** to inspect the raw estimator response:
- The JSON appears in a **dark, resizable** box (same look & feel as the Outputs panel).  
- Use **Copy** to copy the JSON or **Download** to save `xrc137-gas-estimate-<timestamp>.json`.  
- The JSON is **read-only**; opening it **does not** trigger any execution.

**What you see**

## 9) Tips & common issues

- **No wallet** → connect your wallet first (the estimator needs the active RPC).  
- **Validation errors** → fix them, then run **Estimate** again.  
- **Empty totals** → ensure your model is present and the RPC call succeeds (network errors show a red message).  
- **Timestamps** → `expireAt` converts Unix seconds to **US** locale (e.g., `Oct 20, 2025, 01:23 PM`).  
- **Export** → keep the JSON with your deployment notes for audits and capacity planning.

## 10) FAQ

**Q: Is ValidationGas paid on-chain?**  
A: No. It’s a heuristic for engine-side validation and preparation (off-chain), shown to provide a realistic “all-in” picture alongside on-chain components.

**Q: Why is Total (all-in) higher than either branch?**  
A: It’s the **worst-case** total across branches to be conservative in planning.

**Q: Do encrypted logs change estimates?**  
A: Yes. The estimator considers encryption and log retention per branch when calculating log costs.

**Q: When should I re-estimate?**  
A: Whenever you change rules, logging, or payload structure — click **Estimate** again to refresh.

## 11) Next steps

- Use the estimate to **budget XGR** for expected runs.  
- Compare **onValid** vs **onInvalid** to see how log and grant settings impact runtime cost.  
- Export the JSON and keep it with your **deployment checklist**.
