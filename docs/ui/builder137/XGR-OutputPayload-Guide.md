# XGR Output Payload (UI Guide)

This guide explains how to use the **Output Payload** panel in the XRC‑137 Builder to produce results in the **onValid** and **onInvalid** branches. It follows the same style as the other UI guides and is aligned 1:1 with the engine (parser & runtime).

---

## 1) What Output Payload does

Each branch (**onValid** / **onInvalid**) can write an **output payload** — i.e., a JSON object of **key → value** pairs — that becomes the step’s result. Values can reference earlier inputs via placeholders or compute values using expressions.

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/output-panel-main.png) — The Output Payload panel with rows and a “+ Field” button for **onValid**/**onInvalid**.

---

## 2) Add or edit an output field

Each row has two parts:

1) **Name** — the output field name (becomes a JSON key)  
2) **Value** — a literal, a placeholder template, or an expression

Click a row to open the editor modal for the **Value**. Type `[` to use autocomplete and insert placeholders from **Payload**, **Contract Reads** (their `saveAs` aliases), or **API extracts**.

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/output-row-editor.png) — A single output row with *Name* and *Value*; the modal shows helper text and suggestions for `[ ... ]`.

---

## 3) Naming rules for output keys (case‑sensitive)

- Output keys are **case‑sensitive** and must be unique **by exact spelling** inside the same branch.  
- Recommended pattern: `^[A-Za-z][A-Za-z0-9_]{0,127}$`  
- **Avoid** square brackets in the **key**: a key like `"[Score]"` is **not** evaluated as a placeholder; it will be written literally.  
- **Hint behavior**: If you typed `[` to pick a suggestion for the **key**, the UI shows a small yellow info line **under the row for 5s**: *“Picked from [ … ] suggestion — keys are stored without brackets (this is just a hint).”*

**Duplicates**  
If you add the **same spelling** twice, a note appears **under the row**: **“duplicate output key — last wins”** (the later row overwrites the earlier one when building the JSON).

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/output-duplicate-warning.png) — A note below the row when duplicates exist; and a yellow info line when a key looks like `[Name]` or was picked via `[`.

---

## 4) Three ways to provide a Value

You can enter the right side (Value) in three forms:

1) **Literal** (no brackets)  
   - Examples: `hello`, `42`, `true`, `false`
   - Stored as-is.

2) **Template with placeholder(s)** (brackets, no operators)  
   - Example: `"[amount]"` or `"DE-[country]"`  
   - If it’s **exactly** `"[name]"`, the engine copies the producer’s value.  
   - If it’s a **string** that mixes text and placeholders (no operators), the engine performs **string substitution**.

3) **Expression** (operators present)  
   - Example: `"[amount] + 5"`, `"[iban].startsWith(\"DE\")"`  
   - Evaluated as CEL; result must be a scalar (string/number/boolean).

**Rules of thumb**  
- Use quotes when you want **strings**; numbers/booleans as plain tokens.  
- To show `[` or `]` inside a string, escape with `[[` and `]]`.

**What you see**

## 5) Placeholders `[key]` in Output Values

The same autocomplete sources as elsewhere apply:

- **Payload** keys (from the Payload panel)  
- **Contract Reads** aliases (`saveAs`)  
- **API extracts** aliases (from the API panel)

All placeholder names are **case‑sensitive** across the builder.

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/output-autocomplete.png) — Typing `[` opens a suggestion list with Payload, Reads, and API aliases.

---

## 6) Branch options (timing & execution) — **gas limit only**

Each branch supports optional controls:

- **waitMs** — delay the branch execution by N milliseconds.  
- **execution** — schedule a follow-up action (if enabled in your project).  
- **encryptLogs / logExpireDays** (if enabled) — protect logs and set retention.

> **Note:** The **Execution** box now supports **gas limit only**. The previous **limitExpression** field and the “Advanced” toggle have been **removed**. Enter a positive integer gas limit when needed. Execution contract address must be a proper 0x… (EIP‑55).

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/output-branch-options.png) — Small header area with *waitMs*, *execution*, and *encryptLogs* toggles; the Execution box shows **Gas Limit** only.

## 7) Examples

**A) onValid — copy and compute**
```json
"onValid": {
  "payload": {
    "userId": "[user.id]",
    "amountPlus5": "[amount] + 5",
    "label": "ok"
  },
  "waitMs": 0
}
```

**B) onInvalid — explain why**
```json
"onInvalid": {
  "payload": {
    "reason": "rules not satisfied",
    "country": "[country]"
  }
}
```

**C) Mixed templates**
```json
"onValid": {
  "payload": {
    "ibanPrefix": "DE-[iban]",
    "result": "[amount] >= 100"
  }
}
```

## 8) Validation (what the UI checks)

- Output **keys** must be non-empty strings (case‑sensitive uniqueness recommended).  
- Output **values** must be string/number/boolean; placeholders must be **known** (produced earlier).  
- Unknown placeholder in Value → error.  
- Keys that look like `[Name]` show a **warning** (not evaluated as placeholder).  
- If you picked a key via `[` suggestion, a yellow info line appears **for 5s** (no action required).  
- Duplicated keys show a **note** (“last wins”).

**What you see**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xgr-network/XGR/main/pictures/ui/builder137/output-validation.png) — Unknown placeholder error and the bracket‑key warning/info shown together.

---

## 9) Tips & Troubleshooting

- **Unknown `[key]`** → ensure the producer (Payload, Read, API) exists and comes **before** Output.  
- **Type mismatch** → numbers vs strings: quote strings, keep numbers plain.  
- **Expression fails** → simplify or split logic in Rules; Output should stay scalar.  
- **Duplicate keys** → keep only one; or let “last wins” intentionally and document it.  
- **Bracket in key** → remove `[` `]` from the **key** (only needed in **values**).

## 10) Next steps

With output fields defined, you can:
- Route through **onValid/onInvalid** based on your Rules,
- Chain into **execution** (if configured),
- Inspect results in your logs (optionally encrypted).
